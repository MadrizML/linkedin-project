# Scraping and Analysing Job Positions from LinkedIn

This project was created with the intent of understanding what are the main requirements for Data Analysts and Data Scientists jobs. To do that we created a crawler to scrap job pages from LinkedIn and processed the text, in order to achieve a report with the most frequent skills that are asked for each position.
