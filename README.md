# Scraping Jobs from Linkedin

This project was created with the intent of understanding what are the main requirements for Data Analysts and Data Scientists jobs. To do that we created a crawler to scrap job pages from Linkedin and process the text, in order to achieve a report with the most frequent skills that are asked for each position.
