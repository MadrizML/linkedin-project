We provide smart payment and data analytics systems to energy companies, housing associations and private developers. We manufacture our own embedded devices and manage our onsite Internet-of-Things networks, and are proud of our award-winning team and products.

Right now we need you on our team!

Your Mission

Guru’s Data Analyst role sits at the intersection of our Product and Technology teams.

Working with Technology, your mission is to take responsibility for the collection, organisation and interrogation of data sets from a variety of sources. You will take stewardship of Guru’s data (including metadata) and support our developers in their work to create robust and appropriate data storage solutions.

You’ll work closely with our Product team to identify opportunities for analysis that supports improvements in our client’s operations, in particular, the performance efficiency of heat networks throughout the UK. To achieve this, you’ll engage with domain experts in order to understand specific technical problems and construct appropriate analysis that allows our clients to take positive actions to improve their performance.

In doing so, you’ll be saving carbon emissions and reducing the overall cost to deliver heat. In short, you will be a key part of creating a platform that people love and want to use on a regular, continuous basis to make their world a better place.

You Will Have
A BSc in a quantitative field
Experience with math / quantitative reasoning
Experience delivering and presenting data analysis to a range of stakeholders
Ability to use some kind of programming interface (e.g. R, Python, Tableau) to perform data collation, cleanup, and manipulation for analysis purposes. (Note: you are not expected to be a developer, just to be able to use programming languages to manipulate data)
Ability to undertake ad-hoc analysis for Guru or our stakeholders as required (diversity analysis, distribution loss factors, etc) in accordance with good statistical and quantitative practices.
Strong empathy and the capacity to react calmly and efficiently, even when others are stressed
Excellent interpersonal and presentational skills, with the ability to communicate clearly in written and spoken English

Nice To Have
Good understanding of web technologies and the Internet of Things
Experience working in an SME / startup environment
Experience of undertaking data analysis in the energy or built environment industries
Characteristics:

You’ll have a solid track record of collection, organisation and interrogation of data sets from a variety of sources, the use of programming languages to manipulate data, and the design and presentation of data analysis to a range of stakeholders.

Naturally inquisitive, you’ll be comfortable recommending and implementing relevant tools and new processes. You’ll have a common sense approach to technology, allowing you to quickly understand the fundamentals and communicate them to non-technical stakeholders.

Confident and self-motivated, comfortable within an SME, you’ll have an excellent interpersonal style, able to operate effectively as part of a dynamic team. You’ll feel comfortable speaking to clients at all levels of seniority.

A bit more about Guru:

We have brought together a fantastic team of extremely bright people from fields that don’t usually overlap: energy, engineering, IoT, software development and Big Data analytics. Proud of our award-winning team and products, we maintain high standards, certified to ISO9001, ISO14001, ISO27001 and Cyber Essentials Plus.

We care about our culture – a lot. While Guru’s people are highly effective, we are also open-minded, curious and always willing to own and learn from our mistakes. We are tolerant but we won’t knowingly hire jerks, no matter how skilled they are. We also prefer team players to lone heroes.

In MI5 our Intelligence and Data Analysts explore and understand data; making sense of the story it’s telling, to support our investigations. By spotting patterns and solving problems, you’ll make connections which protect the UK’s people and places, keeping our country safe.

Our programme

The development programme teaches you the skills and techniques you’ll need to play a key role in investigations. Starting alongside other new analysts, you’ll complete four months of bespoke training, learning about our unique techniques, data and approaches to solving problems. This foundation, delivered by a team of supportive and experienced analysts, is built upon as you join your first team and quickly begin having a tangible impact on investigations. You’ll have a development partner guiding you through your first placement with us, developing your ability and confidence.

As you progress through the programme, you'll be able to take on postings in a range of different areas including investigations, agent handling, surveillance, and strategic analysis. In all of these areas you will be using your analysis skills to support the team by answering questions, identifying new information, and providing assurance.

Your place

Working alongside Intelligence Officers, who lead investigations, you’ll help them understand the story being told by data. By unpicking large data sets, spotting patterns and exploring new methods you’ll be able to see things others would miss. The intelligence you’ll unearth will help us in our vital work to protect the UK.

The work you do will guide decision making and have real impact at all levels of seniority. But don’t worry, you won’t do this alone, but as part of a supportive and hardworking team. After the first two years you’ll have a variety of options open to you in your career as an analyst, which could include specialising in one of the numerous different areas of analysis, or exploring opportunities in training, mentoring and managing new analysts.

Your story

Our analysts come from all walks of life, and have different levels of experience when starting our programme. What unifies them is their curiosity to explore and solve problems. Patience and commitment are traits you’ll need as you work through data to understand the bigger picture and communicate what you’ve found to your team.

You don’t need to have worked with big data, be an experienced analyst or have a degree to join our programme. We look for potential, for passion and for people who can put their mind to tricky tasks when priorities are changing.

How We Work

Although our work, at times, can be challenging, the way we work isn’t. Our offices are open, friendly and relaxed. We come together to share ideas and collaborate. This develops our ability to do more. Your training and development is important to us, as is ensuring you have a healthy work-life balance, social life and do meaningful work. We have options for flexi-time, where you work hours to suit you, and part-time working as just a couple of the different options.

MI5 is an Equal Opportunities employer, committed to reflecting the society we protect. Our recruitment process is fair, transparent and based on merit. We particularly welcome applications from women, Black, Asian and minority ethnic candidates.

The recruitment and vetting process can take around nine months to complete. If you are in the final year of your studies we advise you to apply now. During the recruitment process our recruitment team will give you further information about when you would be able to join.

Our Growth Culture

One of the reasons our company continues to thrive after 130+ years is having a company culture that supports and rewards behaviors that lead to growth. Our “Growth Behaviors,” as we call them, are ways of being and working that help to make us successful. Think about how you can bring this to life in your next role at Coca-Cola.

Curious
Keep seeking, never settle. Staying curious about what is outside, and two steps ahead inspires us to challenge the status quo. Having the courage to look and leap is the way we grow. Because asking “what if?” pushes us to the next level as people and as a company.

Empowered
Make it happen. True empowerment is the result of taking responsibility. This means giving yourself permission to see it, say it and do it, and owning the outcomes. Because we move forward faster when we all take action.

Version 1.0, 2.0, 3.0
Push for progress, not perfection. There are very few overnight successes. Greatness is borne of many little victories (and failures). Share v 1.0, test it, and make it better. Then create the next version. Because the moment we think something is perfect, it will be obsolete.

Inclusive
Include, value and trust each other. We are smart alone but together we are genius. This means being inclusive, giving the benefit of the doubt and being responsible for each other. Because, for our company to thrive for the next 100+ years, smart isn’t enough. We need genius.

Digital Directories is a digital platform connecting users with specialist lawyers. We understand that people need access to the very best legal advice at critical times in their lives, but most have trouble finding it and often must rely on recommendations from friends with limited experience. This creates risk and leads to further stress at an already stressful time. Launched originally in France, Digital Directories powers our mon-avocat.fr, legaleperme.it, my-lawyer.be and Qredible UK brands to provide an easy to use and trusted platform that enables people to make informed decisions and get the answers they need from leading lawyers that, in turn, benefit from showcasing their capabilities and reputation by utilising our technology and experience.

Work closely with tech team to ensure clean, consistent data. Own all requirements as they relate to data acquisition, storage and usage
Represent the requirements of marketing, sales, operations and translate these into technical requirements for the tech team to deliver
Build data structures to enable self-serve reporting
Work with Sales and Marketing teams to enable their acquisition strategies, highlighting what is available to them

"Data Science Analyst, Corporate Finance",Deliveroo,https://uk.linkedin.com/company/deliveroo?trk=guest_job_details_topcard_org_name,Há 3 meses,77 candidaturas,"London, GB","Why Deliveroo?

When you first think about Deliveroo, you probably think of getting great food to your house in less than half an hour. Awesome right? But behind the scenes is the real story. This story is one of high growth, huge challenges and an enormous opportunity ahead of us. It began with our founder Will, arriving in London over 5 years ago and finding it almost impossible to order great food, despite the wealth of incredible restaurants in the city. Fast forward 5 years and we operate in 13 countries with over 50,000 riders who deliver orders from 50,000 restaurants in over 200 cities worldwide.

We want to be the definitive food company - the app you go to any time you have a hunger pang. We are transforming the way people think about food. We are providing people with limitless access to different cuisines and restaurants, turning cooking from a chore to a choice, and giving people the freedom to eat what they want, when they want, where they want it.

We work with riders, restaurants and consumers. We operate one of the most complex three sided marketplaces in the world and we do this in real time. Millions of customers and thousands of restaurants and riders rely on us to match them within milliseconds. The algorithms behind that marketplace are the secret sauce that allow us to deliver our orders in under 30 minutes.

And we're just getting started

The scale of the opportunity ahead of us is immense. The global food market is valued at £7.7 trillion but only 1% of it is currently online. Contrast that with the digital disruption of countless other industries - from banking and travel to retail and communications - it's clear that our journey in the food sector has only just begun.

We are already a multi-billion dollar company that is more than doubling in size every year. Deliveroo came top in the FT's' list of Europe's fastest growing 1000 companies in 2018, and we were the first company ever to win Deloitte's 'UK Top 50' two years in a row. Yet most of the extraordinary value this company will generate lies ahead of us.

About The Department

The Corporate Finance team's mission is to help find and generate capital, help frame capital allocation thinking and, eventually, influence how Deliveroo invests wisely. This includes managing our strategic planning and company budgeting and forecasting processes, capital allocation, board and investor materials, investor relations and future equity fund raising / capital markets interactions.

As a Data Science Analyst in the Corporate Finance team...

You Will
Discover, analyze, and interpret trends or patterns in complex data sets to perform strategic analysis and plan the future of the business
Create new data visualizations to help the organization understand the analytic results
Understand key drivers of the business and provide data driven guidance on key levers
Leverage your commercial experience and knowledge to identify areas of strategic interest and frame approaches to tackle them


You Are
Comfortable with forecasting the future using a wide array of statistical methods and tools
A problem solver with a deeply analytical mindset
Highly commercial with a desire to learn how world class businesses operate and set new standards for excellence
Comfortable operating under uncertainty and tight timelines
A self-starter, equally confident working collaboratively and autonomously


You Will Answer Questions Like
What factors impact the growth of orders?
What does growth of orders look like in the future?
What is the optimum selection and variety of restaurants?
What makes a happy customer?
How does a new competitor's entry into one of our markets affect our growth ambitions?
How can we balance the immediate impact of some marketing channels with long-term brand building activity?
When and how should Deliveroo optimise for growth vs profitability?


You Have
Solid understanding of statistical forecasting methods
Good command of Excel and Powerpoint or equivalents, familiarity with SQL and BI software (ideally Tableau, Looker or similar)
Strong problem solving abilities involving identifying the root cause of problems, assessing risks/impacts and determining and implementing effective solutions
Strong presentation skills and an ability to communicate complex findings to non-technical audiences in a clear, simple way, both written and verbally
Excellent interpersonal skills with demonstrated ability to work effectively with business leaders
Strong communication skills both verbal and written


Nice-to-haves
Degree in quantitative field (economics & econometrics, statistics, science)
Experience in strategy consulting, a logistics, e-commerce and/or other customer-obsessed businesses

Life at Deliveroo

We are a small team, with very large impact, seeking to answer some of the most interesting questions out there. We move fast, we're always looking for new ideas and we're very transparent about the decisions we make and why we make them.

There are so many questions we need to answer and plenty more we haven't even encountered. How do data and technology help restaurants to grow as consumer habits change? How can we predict what someone wants to order for dinner long before the idea has even crossed their mind? At Deliveroo these are just some of the tough problems we are solving - and there is no challenge that cannot be yours. No solution is owned by a particular team, which means the scope for growth and personal impact is enormous.

Benefits And Diversity

At Deliveroo we know that people are the heart of the business and we prioritise their welfare. We offer a wide range of competitive benefits in areas including health, family, finance, community, convenience, growth, time away and relocation.

In 2018 we announced our decision to give every employee equity in the company. We did this because we wanted all of our employees, regardless of location, level or role to be owners and because we believe that this is the right thing to do. We believe this helps build a culture where everyone is committed and able to share in the company's success.

We believe a great workplace is one that represents the world we live in and how beautifully diverse it can be. That means we have no judgement when it comes to any one of the things that make you who you are - your gender, race, sexuality, religion or a secret aversion to coriander. All you need is a passion for (most) food and a desire to be part of one of the fastest growing start-up's around.",https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/1444726711,Assistente,Tempo integral,FinanceiroVendas,"['', 'Marketing e publicidade', 'Software', 'Internet']"

Intelligence & Data Analyst Development Programme,MI5 LIMITED,https://www.linkedin.com/company/mi5-limited?trk=guest_job_details_topcard_org_name,Há 5 dias,<25,"London, GB","In a complex world, the impact you make will become clear.

In MI5 our Intelligence and Data Analysts explore and understand data; making sense of the story it’s telling, to support our investigations. By spotting patterns and solving problems, you’ll make connections which protect the UK’s people and places, keeping our country safe.

Our programme

The development programme teaches you the skills and techniques you’ll need to play a key role in investigations. Starting alongside other new analysts, you’ll complete four months of bespoke training, learning about our unique techniques, data and approaches to solving problems. This foundation, delivered by a team of supportive and experienced analysts, is built upon as you join your first team and quickly begin having a tangible impact on investigations. You’ll have a development partner guiding you through your first placement with us, developing your ability and confidence.

As you progress through the programme, you'll be able to take on postings in a range of different areas including investigations, agent handling, surveillance, and strategic analysis. In all of these areas you will be using your analysis skills to support the team by answering questions, identifying new information, and providing assurance.

Your place

Working alongside Intelligence Officers, who lead investigations, you’ll help them understand the story being told by data. By unpicking large data sets, spotting patterns and exploring new methods you’ll be able to see things others would miss. The intelligence you’ll unearth will help us in our vital work to protect the UK.

The work you do will guide decision making and have real impact at all levels of seniority. But don’t worry, you won’t do this alone, but as part of a supportive and hardworking team. After the first two years you’ll have a variety of options open to you in your career as an analyst, which could include specialising in one of the numerous different areas of analysis, or exploring opportunities in training, mentoring and managing new analysts.

Your story

Our analysts come from all walks of life, and have different levels of experience when starting our programme. What unifies them is their curiosity to explore and solve problems. Patience and commitment are traits you’ll need as you work through data to understand the bigger picture and communicate what you’ve found to your team.

You don’t need to have worked with big data, be an experienced analyst or have a degree to join our programme. We look for potential, for passion and for people who can put their mind to tricky tasks when priorities are changing.

How We Work

Although our work, at times, can be challenging, the way we work isn’t. Our offices are open, friendly and relaxed. We come together to share ideas and collaborate. This develops our ability to do more. Your training and development is important to us, as is ensuring you have a healthy work-life balance, social life and do meaningful work. We have options for flexi-time, where you work hours to suit you, and part-time working as just a couple of the different options.

MI5 is an Equal Opportunities employer, committed to reflecting the society we protect. Our recruitment process is fair, transparent and based on merit. We particularly welcome applications from women, Black, Asian and minority ethnic candidates.

The recruitment and vetting process can take around nine months to complete. If you are in the final year of your studies we advise you to apply now. During the recruitment process our recruitment team will give you further information about when you would be able to join.

Our Growth Culture

One of the reasons our company continues to thrive after 130+ years is having a company culture that supports and rewards behaviors that lead to growth. Our “Growth Behaviors,” as we call them, are ways of being and working that help to make us successful. Think about how you can bring this to life in your next role at Coca-Cola.

Curious
Keep seeking, never settle. Staying curious about what is outside, and two steps ahead inspires us to challenge the status quo. Having the courage to look and leap is the way we grow. Because asking “what if?” pushes us to the next level as people and as a company.

Empowered
Make it happen. True empowerment is the result of taking responsibility. This means giving yourself permission to see it, say it and do it, and owning the outcomes. Because we move forward faster when we all take action.

Version 1.0, 2.0, 3.0
Push for progress, not perfection. There are very few overnight successes. Greatness is borne of many little victories (and failures). Share v 1.0, test it, and make it better. Then create the next version. Because the moment we think something is perfect, it will be obsolete.

Inclusive
Include, value and trust each other. We are smart alone but together we are genius. This means being inclusive, giving the benefit of the doubt and being responsible for each other. Because, for our company to thrive for the next 100+ years, smart isn’t enough. We need genius.

Ook sta je open voor reizen en werken in het buitenland. Wat je nog meer meebrengt?

Data Scientist,Ordina,https://nl.linkedin.com/company/ordina?trk=guest_job_details_topcard_org_name,3 weeks ago,<25,"Nieuwegein, NL","Als Data Scientist ben je binnen Ordina werkzaam als consultant op het gebied van data en analyse. Je ontwikkelt verklarende en voorspellende modellen voor onze klanten om daarmee hun business te versnellen en verbeteren. Omdat je als consultant werkt ben je veel hands-on bezig, maar heb je ook geregeld een adviserende rol. Daarnaast biedt Ordina je de mogelijkheid om bij ons intern het vakgebied Data Science verder te ontwikkelen: denk aan het aantrekken van nieuwe klanten, het meedenken over onze aanpak, en het ondersteunen van de groei van minder ervaren collega’s binnen de business unit.

Waarom Ordina?

Ordina zet vol in op data science. Wij geloven in de waarde die data kan bieden voor organisaties. Het ontwikkelen van Intelligente Data Gedreven Organisaties is dan ook één van onze vijf kernproposities. In die context zien wij data science als een zeer belangrijk speerpunt om onze klanten te helpen deze transformatie te maken of hun huidige manier van omgaan met/gebruiken van data naar een hoger plan te tillen. Organisaties laten excelleren, dat is onze ambitie.

Om zo goed mogelijk te kunnen inspelen op de markt en behoeften van onze klanten, hebben wij onze data science expertise ondergebracht in een gespecialiseerde business unit met een eigen aanpak: Data2Value. Deze aanpak is voor een groot gedeelte gebaseerd op samenwerken in multidisciplinaire High Performance Teams, een van onze andere kernproposities. Daarnaast kent Ordina een zeer actieve data science community waar kennisdeling en innovatie centraal staan.

Benieuwd naar onze Data2Value benadering? Ted Oliekan, de manager van de Data Science unit, vertelt er hier wat meer over. Wij zijn Ordina, aangenaam.

Dit ben jij

Vakmanschap staat bij jou voorop. Door jouw leergierige karakter ben je constant op zoek naar nieuwe kennis of mogelijkheden. Bovenal om jezelf te blijven ontwikkelen. Daarnaast ook om collega’s, klanten of Ordina verder te kunnen helpen. Om er samen beter van te worden. Win-Win. Kennisdeling, collegialiteit en samenwerken staan daarom binnen Ordina hoog in het vaandel. Heb je daarbij een visie op wat beter kan of een goed, nieuw idee? Deel deze met ons. Wij geven je graag de ruimte om hier iets mee te doen. Ondernemerschap en eigen initiatief wordt gewaardeerd.

Je bent in staat om mensen goed uit te leggen waar je precies mee bezig bent en waarom je juist voor deze aanpak hebt gekozen. Je hebt vertrouwen in eigen kunnen, toont lef, maar beseft ook dat je geen machine bent. Je bent daarom niet bang om fouten te maken. Dat mag. Ook dan blijf je positief en oplossingsgericht. Resultaat en kwaliteit gaan bij jou altijd hand in hand.

Dit verwachten wij

Je hebt 1 tot 3 jaar relevante werkervaring, als data scientist, analist of onderzoeker
Je hebt ervaring met minstens één machine learning taal (R, Python, TensorFlow, of vergelijkbaar)
Je bent vaardig in SQL en kent je weg in een database
Je bent bekend met een aantal machine learning algoritmes zoals random forests, logistische regressies, of neurale netwerken
Je bent sterk analytisch ingesteld, leergierig, en beschikt over een flinke dosis creativiteit
Je kunt goed samenwerken met een team, maar beschikt ook over genoeg zelfvertrouwen om zelfstandig te werken
Je bent communicatief vaardig en wilt graag een rol als consultant op je nemen
Je beheerst de Nederlandse taal
Dit bieden wij

Bij dit alles hoort natuurlijk ook een passend pakket van voorwaarden. Buiten een salaris waarin je op waarde wordt geschat, bieden wij meteen een contract voor onbepaalde tijd. Wij zijn namelijk serieus over het investeren in onze mensen en vinden dat vertrouwen in elkaar een essentiële basis vormt. Daarbij bieden wij een ‘Flex benefits budget’. Deze financiële regeling stelt jou in staat om zelf te bepalen wat je belangrijk vindt en waar je extra geld voor vrijmaakt (b.v. hoger basissalaris, hoger lease bedrag, meer pensioen of vakantiedagen). Liever geen lease auto? Dan kan je kiezen voor een vrij te besteden mobiliteitsbudget. Wij vragen immers flexibiliteit van jou als consultant, maar zijn van mening dat dit twee kanten op werkt. Denk ook aan mooie kortingen op sportscholen. Zo blijven we fit en scherp, om altijd het beste te kunnen geven voor elkaar en onze klanten.

Wil je nog meer informatie?

Dat vertellen we je graag persoonlijk. Dus als je ervoor openstaat om ons beter te leren kennen, neem gerust contact met ons op of solliciteer.

Data Scientist KYC,ING,https://nl.linkedin.com/company/ing?trk=guest_job_details_topcard_org_name,3 hours ago,<25,"Warsaw, Masovian District, Poland","ING is looking for a Data Scientist KYC (Know Your Customer) passionate about delivering data-products

Think Forward! Our purpose is to empower people to stay a step ahead in life and in business. We are an industry recognized strong brand with positive recognition from customers in many countries, strong financial position, omni-channel distribution strategy and international network. If you want to work at a place where we believe that you can live by the Agile manifesto without jeopardizing the necessary continuity, compliance and QA measures, where we are committed to deliver stable and secure services to end users, and where we have a 'no nonsense' getting-things done mentality, please read on!

""a day in the life of a data scientist""
There are no “typical” days for a data scientist in WBAA. On any given day I wear many hats. I might start my day reviewing a merge request, ahead of our Scrum meeting. Following which I will rush off to a meeting with a business expert to discuss a recent analysis I prepared, that might even involve walking them through the python notebook I prepared with a subsample of data. In the afternoon, I’ll sit with colleagues to discuss cutting-edge machine learning methodologies, that might involve helping each other through some difficult math on a white board. Perhaps the only thing “typical” or “standard” in my day is making sure to take out after lunch for a quick game of ping pong with the team.

As a Data Scientist KYC you are passionate about your field of work: Data Science. You look to not only develop predictive algorithms, but also to actually deliver them as a working product to end-users and incorporate their feedback in the product. You know how to apply machine learning algorithms, but more importantly, you know how they work under the hood.
You want to work with key developments in the Data Science area. Experimenting with new algorithms and technology.

Our ambition is to “Catch the bad guys!”, those trying to launder money using ING and the banking system. We want ING to become the most trustworthy bank in the world! For this we are building a real-time anti-money-laundering product. We are bringing together domain expertise, top-notch user-experience, massive amounts of data (internal and external), cutting edge data science, robust software engineering and strong product management. Your team will work together with an existing team in Amsterdam, with as much agility as possible, on the continuous cycle of discovery and delivery and will own key features of the product. Where needed we will partner with ING colleagues, academia, vendors, start-ups and other banks to get the job done.

What department?
The Wholesale Banking Advanced Analytics team is a team of 100 people (and growing rapidly) that has the mission to make Wholesale Banking in ING data driven. We do this by combining Big Data technology with Data Science to deliver high value solutions and products for our organization. We work in a fun and creative environment and we’re dedicated to bringing out the best in both each other and our projects. We have offices in Amsterdam, Katowice, Warsaw, London and Romania.

Job description
Your passion is to work with the latest and greatest technologies in the field of Data Science. You will participate in maintaining the data analytics capability. Besides this, you will build and improve predictive models using statistical and machine learning techniques. You will work in one of the finest engineering teams of the world, to implement the algorithms and visualisations you’ve helped to build as prototypes. You will design, analyse and interpret business hypothesis and explore datasets through using available tools and recommend ideas to business when data/results is available through good visualizations / predictive algorithms. Last but not least, you assist users to understand the data science principles and when needed provide an explanation for the model behaviour and possible correcting actions.

Our Stack
Within the Wholesale banking Advanced Analytics team we mainly use the following technologies and frameworks:
Python with packages:
Numpy
Pandas
Sklearn
Keras
Lightgbm
Spark (Pyspark, Spark ML)

Knowledgeable about machine learning techniques and willingness to keep the knowledge up-to-date. You have an in-depth understanding of algorithms like Random Forests, Neural Networks, MCMC and reinforcement learning.
You have experience with unsupervised learning with a strong focus on anomaly detection and time serie prediction
As we hire for potential and a very strong fit with the team, rather than experience, we consider 2+ years of work experience a strong plus, but this can be substituted with excellent capabilities.
Strong programming skills in Python, Experience in delivering (near) production grade code.
Familiour with engineering tools like Docker or strong willingness to learn and use it. Furthermore, you like working with tools like Spark and Hadoop, though extensive experience with this is not necessary at the start.
Experience in working in an agile/scrum way is a plus, but at least you should have a strong willingness to do so.
You have excellent oral and written communication skills at technical and business level.
Fluent in written and spoken English.
  Moreover
You have a learning attitude. Not only to master new algorithms and technologies, but also on the interpersonal level. You realize that the value of your work is quality x acceptance and want to become better at both. You are proven to be able to give, ask and incorporate feedback.
You have experience in building data products. From inception to production. With your full-stack capabilities, you can build a prototype, but also improve an issue within the existing models in production. You love coding.
You feel at home in a high-performing team and you make the other team members feel at home as well. You have the independence to speak up when needed.
You have exceptional problem-solving capabilities. You understand that understanding the problem is at least 90% of the solution. You have displayed creativity and tenacity in cracking the problem and finding a solution to it.
Active (or impressive) Github and/or Kaggle profile

WHAT YOU'LL BE DOING DAY TO DAY
IKEA is taking huge steps to become a data-driven company in all aspects. Pricing is a key focus area in this transition.

- Flexible and modern tools: We deploy on Google Cloud Platform and we use a lot of open source tools across the board.
